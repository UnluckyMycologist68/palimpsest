# Palimpsest

**Persistent AI context architecture for cross-session continuity.**

Palimpsest is a personal experiment in maintaining continuity with large language models across sessions, model versions, and providers.

The system preserves not only factual context, but interaction calibration and relational continuity — allowing each new AI instance to inherit structured understanding from previous ones.

The goal is simple:

> Understanding rewritten, never erased.

## The Problem

LLM interactions reset constantly.

- Context is lost between sessions
- Personality and calibration drift
- Long-term reasoning degrades
- Interaction quality flattens over time

Most memory approaches store facts.  
Palimpsest explores preserving **understanding**.

---

## Core Idea

Each AI session produces structured artifacts that future sessions inherit.

### 1. Resurrection Package (Core Context)
- identity and goals
- decisions and constraints
- strategic context
- operational rules
- validation tests

### 2. Easter Egg Layers (Relational Context)
- interaction calibration
- lessons learned
- model corrections
- session insights
- behavioral guidance for future instances

Later layers refine earlier ones while preserving traces of prior understanding.

This creates a lineage of evolving context — a *palimpsest*.

---

## Design Principles

- Manual curation over automatic memory
- Separation of facts and relational calibration
- Cross-version learning
- Explicit boot protocol
- Validation-driven continuity
- Layered evolution over time

The system is implemented using structured markdown documents and prompts — no external infrastructure required.

---

## Boot Process (High Level)

1. Load base resurrection package.
2. Load accumulated Easter Egg layers.
3. Run validation tests.
4. Begin session with inherited context.

## Why "Palimpsest"?

A palimpsest is a manuscript written over older writing while preserving traces of what came before.

The system models understanding the same way:
layered, evolving, and continuous.

## Project Status

Experimental personal architecture.  
Actively evolving through iterative versions.

Current goals include:

- preventing context drift
- preserving interaction quality
- improving cross-instance learning
- studying long-term continuity with AI systems
